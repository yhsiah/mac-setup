# Mac Setup Helper

## What is this?

As someone who works in tech, I need to set up a fresh macbook for myself once every so often when starting a new job, or getting a new laptop. This is a set of guidance notes to help make that process easier for myself, and maybe even others who might find this useful.

I will attempt to keep this setup guide minimal and simple, and not add anything unneccessary. I also intend to automate this process at some point.

For reference, I am a QA Engineer and so you may find this to be slightly oriented towards that.
